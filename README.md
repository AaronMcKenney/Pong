Pong
====

Version 1.0

A simple game of Pong implemented in C++ on a Linux machine.
The following libraries must be installed in order to play:
libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev

This version of Pong requires two players, who play on the same keyboard.
P1 uses the 'w' key to move the paddle up and the 'd' key to move it down.
P2 uses the arrow keys instead.
The first player to hit 3 points wins.

To install the game, enter "make"
To play the game, enter "./pong"
